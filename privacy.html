          This privacy policy governs your use of the software applications for
          mobile devices hosted at the NIC e-Gov Mobile App Store in Google
          Play. The Applications primarily provide eGovernance Services to
          deliver better citizen services by the government. The contents
          published on these Applications are provided by the concerned
          Ministries/Departments of the Government of India or allied government
          establishments. The information made available through these
          applications may not carry any legal sanctity and is for general
          reference purposes only, unless otherwise specified. While every
          effort has been made to provide accurate and reliable information
          through these applications, users are advised to verify the
          correctness of the facts published here with the concerned
          authorities. Neither the National Informatics Centre nor the
          Government of India and its allied establishments will be responsible
          for the accuracy or completeness of the contents available in these

        <h2>User-Provided Information</h2>
        <p>
          The Application may collect information you provide when using the
          services. While registration is not required and account creation is
          not allowed through the app, you may still interact with the
          Application in various ways. The types of information you may provide
          include:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Information you provide when contacting us for help or support.
          </li>
          <li>
            Details related to payment, if relevant for specific services
            offered through the Application.
          </li>
          <li>

            contact details, or other data necessary for the service.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>

        <h2>Automatically Collected Information</h2>
        <p>
          The Application may automatically collect certain data, including but
          not limited to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Mobile device type, unique device ID, IP address, and mobile
            operating system.

          <li>Mobile Internet browser type.</li>
          <li>Information about how you use the Application.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The mobile application may use GPS technology or similar methods to
          determine your current location. This may be used to identify the city
          you are located in and to display a map. If location data is required
          for services offered by the Application, it may be shared with
          authorities as needed for policy decisions or taking action.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you do not want the Application to use your location, turn off the
          location services in your account settings, mobile phone settings, or
          within the mobile application itself. However, this may disable
          location-based services provided by the Application.

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>
          We are committed to protecting the confidentiality of your
          information. We employ physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards
          to protect the data we process and maintain. For example, access to
          this information is limited to authorized employees and contractors
          who need the data to operate, develop, or improve the Application.
          However, no security system is impenetrable, and we cannot guarantee
          absolute security.

          consent, we will take steps to delete that information promptly.
